### Setting up the Amazon S3 connector

See the [Developer guide](../../docs/DEVELOPING.md) for setting up connectors.

### Overview

The advanced sync rules consist of sets of rules, each having one or more parameters:

1. bucket: Name of Amazon S3 bucket for which the rule would execute.
2. extension(optional): List of file extensions to be added for the sync. Defaults to empty list (i.e.sync all file extensions).
3. prefix(optional): Prefix is a string of characters at the beginning of the object key name, this will index files and folder data that matches with prefix value. Defaults to ""(i.e. sync all bucket objects).

### Example advanced sync rules

### Indexing files and folders recursively by specifying prefix

#### Case1: Fetch files/folder starting with docs. Use '/' to fetch from subdirectory

```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "bucket1",
    "prefix": "folder1/docs"
  }

]

```

#### Case2: Fetch files/folder starting with folder1

```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "folder1"
  }
]

```

### Indexing files and folders by specifying extensions

#### Case1: Fetch all objects which starts with `abc` and then filter using extension

```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "abc",
    "extension": [".txt", ".png"]
  }
]

```
