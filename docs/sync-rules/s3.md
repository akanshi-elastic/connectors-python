### Setting up the Amazon S3 connector

See the [Developer guide](../../docs/DEVELOPING.md) for setting up connectors.

### Example advanced sync rules

#### Indexing files and folders recursively

```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "bucket1",
    "prefix": "folder1/folder2", # this will fetch files starting with folder2 and files in folder2
    "extension": []
  },
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "folder1", # this will fetch files starting with folder1 and files in folder1
    "extension": []
  },
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "", # empty prefix value fetch all objects from mentioned bucket
  },

]

```

#### Indexing files and folders by specifying extensions

```json
[
  {
    "bucket": "bucket1",
    "prefix": "",  # empty prefix value fetch all objects with extension .txt and .png
    "extension": [".txt", ".png"]
  },
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "abc", # this will fetch all objects which starts with `abc` and then filter using extension
    "extension": [".txt", ".png"]
  },
  {
    "bucket": "bucket2",
    "prefix": "abc",
    "extension": [] # empty list will fetch objects for any type of extensions
  },
]

```
